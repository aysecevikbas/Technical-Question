# Technical-Question
. Introduction

This document specifies the requirements and design for the user management screen. This screen allows administrators to create, view, edit, and manage user accounts within the system.

2. User Roles

This screen is intended for users with administrator privileges.

3. Screen Layout

The user management screen is divided into two main sections:

Navigation Pane (Left): This pane provides navigation options for managing users. It will contain buttons or links for:
View All Users
Create New User
Search Users (Optional)
Content Area (Right): This area displays the content based on the selected navigation option. It will contain elements for:
View All Users:
A table listing all users with columns for: Username, Email, Roles, Status (Active/Inactive), and Actions (Edit/Delete).
Pagination controls (if a large number of users exist).
Create New User:
A form to create a new user account with fields for:
Username (text input, required)
Email (email input, required)
Password (password input, required)
Confirm Password (password input, required)
Roles (multi-select dropdown, allowing selection of multiple roles)
Status (radio buttons for Active/Inactive)
Submit button to create the new user account.
Edit User (when clicking the Edit button on a user in the View All Users table):
A pre-populated form with the existing user's details, allowing edits to:
Username (text input)
Email (email input)
Roles (multi-select dropdown)
Status (radio buttons)
Save button to update the user information.
Cancel button to discard changes.
4. User Interaction

Clicking on a navigation button in the left pane will display the corresponding content in the right pane.
In the "View All Users" table:
Clicking on the "Edit" button for a user will open the "Edit User" form pre-populated with that user's details.
Clicking on the "Delete" button for a user will prompt the user for confirmation before deleting the account.
In the "Create New User" form:
Filling out the form and clicking the "Submit" button will attempt to create a new user account. The system should perform validation on the form data (e.g., username uniqueness, password strength). Upon successful creation, the user should be redirected to the "View All Users" table with the new user listed.
In the "Edit User" form:
Modifying the user details and clicking "Save" will update the user information in the system. Upon success, the user should be redirected back to the "View All Users" table with the updated information displayed.
Clicking "Cancel" will discard any changes and return to the "View All Users" table.
5. Initial Display

Upon loading the user management screen, the "View All Users" section will be displayed by default, showing a table listing all existing users.
6. Additional Considerations

Implement clear visual cues to indicate required form fields.
Provide informative error messages for failed user creation or update attempts.
Consider incorporating user search functionality (by username or email) for easier navigation in case of a large number of users.
Implement proper access control to ensure only authorized users can access and manage user accounts.
7. Future Enhancements

Integrate user filtering options (e.g., by role, status).
Implement user import/export functionalities.
Allow for individual user password resets.
